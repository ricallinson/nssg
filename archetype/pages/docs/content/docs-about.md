# What is a Static Site Generator?

You may have heard of static site generators such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) made popular by [Github](https://github.com/),
but why would you want to use one vs a _Content Management System_ [CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), [Durpal](https://www.drupal.org/) or [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/)?

## Speed

The short answer is speed (pun intended).
Without getting too technical, all the aforementioned CMS solutions require code to be executed on a server.
This takes time and money. Loading configurations, connecting to databases, converting raw data to HTML.
All this computation is performed every time a user clicks on a [link](/).

The industry solution to this performance issue is caching.
That being saving the output for a HTTP request so it doesn't have to be computed each time a request is made.
The issue with this approach is that it costs hard cash and is a complex problem to get right.
Just search for [WordPress performance](https://www.google.com/search?q=wordpress+performance) and you will see the size of the market willing to take your money.

## What's Changed?

Computers are faster than they have ever been and getting faster.
In days gone by you couldn't compute an entire website every time you made a spelling mistake.
Today your phone can do it.
As a point of fact, this whole website you are reading now was computed faster than it took to load this single page in your web browser.

How? To understand why you need to use a static site generator you have to understand the contemporary internet.
But don't worry, it's simple.
The absolute fastest...
